# Section 1. Experimentation

## Data Management
### Read and write a Delta table  
### View Delta table history and load a previous version of a Delta table
### Create, overwrite, merge, and read Feature Store tables in machine learning workflows

## Experiment Tracking
### Manually log parameters, models, and evaluation metrics using MLflow
### Programmatically access and use data, metadata, and models from MLflow experiments

## Advanced Experiment Tracking
### Perform MLflow experiment tracking workflows using model signatures and input examples
### Identify the requirements for tracking nested runs
### Describe the process of enabling autologging, including with the use of Hyperopt
### Log and view artifacts like SHAP plots, custom visualizations, feature data, images, and metadata
