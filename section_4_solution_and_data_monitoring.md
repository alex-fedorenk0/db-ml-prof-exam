# Section 4: Solution and Data Monitoring

## Drift Types

### Compare and contrast label drift and feature drift

### Identify scenarios in which feature drift and/or label drift are likely to occur

### Describe concept drift and its impact on model efficacy


## Drift Tests and Monitoring

### Describe summary statistic monitoring as a simple solution for numeric feature drift

### Describe mode, unique values, and missing values as simple solutions for categorical feature drift

### Describe tests as more robust monitoring solutions for numeric feature drift than simple summary statistics

### Describe tests as more robust monitoring solutions for categorical feature drift than simple summary statistics

### Compare and contrast Jenson-Shannon divergence and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for numerical drift detection

### Identify a scenario in which a chi-square test would be useful


## Comprehensive Drift Solutions

### Describe a common workflow for measuring concept drift and feature drift

### Identify when retraining and deploying an updated model is a probable solution to drift

### Test whether the updated model performs better on the more recent data
